/**
 * This is an intermediary script for reporting fail2ban events to AbuseIPDB.
 *
 * You should install this script on a web server you control. The accompanying
 * config.php file needs to be present and must contain your AbuseIPDB API key.
 * Finally, fail2ban itself must be configured to post events to this script.
 *
 * See the GitHub repository for documentation.
